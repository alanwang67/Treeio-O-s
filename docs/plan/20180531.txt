Which jobs are most crucial?

-creating a workable map
-making sure the screen updates at a consistent rate enough to play it
-finding a way for towers and enemies to move around map

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

The core functionality consists of having a working tower defense game which
consists of working towers and enemies. The non-essential components include
having multiple levels, having complex images for the towers and enemies, and
including attack speed for the towers and enemies. 

Which components are prerequisites for others?

The components that are the prerequisites for others is a map that works so
we can build a method that creates towers and enemies. 

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?

The tasks that can be delegated are the creation of different towers and enemies
the tasks that must be worked together on are the creation of maps and the
abstract classes for the towers and enemies. 

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
